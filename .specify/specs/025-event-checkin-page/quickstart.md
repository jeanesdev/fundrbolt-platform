# Quickstart: Event check-in page

## Prerequisites
- Backend and admin PWA running locally.
- An admin or event manager account with access to an event that has registrations.

## Steps
1. Start the backend and admin PWA using the standard project commands.
2. Sign in to the admin PWA with an authorized account.
3. Open the event check-in page for the target event.
4. Search for a guest by name, phone number, or email and perform check-in or updates.
5. Review the check-in dashboard totals and the searchable list of checked-in guests.

## Expected Results
- Check-ins record a timestamp and appear in the dashboard.
- Updates to donor info, bidder/table numbers, dinner selection, and ticket transfers are saved and reflected immediately.
- Check-outs require a reason and are logged.
