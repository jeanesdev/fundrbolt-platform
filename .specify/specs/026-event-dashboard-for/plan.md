# Implementation Plan: Event Dashboard for Admin PWA

**Branch**: `026-event-dashboard-for` | **Date**: 2026-02-07 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/026-event-dashboard-for/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Deliver an admin-facing event dashboard that visualizes fundraising progress versus goal with source breakdowns, projections, pacing, and segment drilldowns. Implement a new backend dashboard aggregation API and an Admin PWA dashboard view using existing React/TypeScript and Recharts components, with 60-second auto-refresh and manual refresh.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 (backend), TypeScript 5.x (frontend)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI 0.120+, SQLAlchemy 2.0+, Pydantic 2.0+, React 19, Vite 7, TanStack Router, Zustand, React Query, Radix UI, Recharts
**Storage**: PostgreSQL 15 (event data), Redis 7 (sessions)
**Testing**: pytest (backend), Vitest + React Testing Library (frontend)
**Target Platform**: Web (Admin PWA)
**Project Type**: Web application (backend + frontend)
**Performance Goals**: Projection updates visible within 2 seconds; dashboard initial load usable within standard Admin PWA expectations
**Constraints**: Auto-refresh every 60 seconds with manual refresh; role-gated access (Super Admin, NPO Admin, NPO Staff)
**Scale/Scope**: Events up to 5,000 guests and 500 tables; multiple revenue sources per event

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Donor-Driven Engagement**: Pass. Dashboard supports fundraising decisions without adding donor friction.
- **Real-Time Reliability**: Pass. This view is near-real-time with 60-second refresh; no bid-critical workflows.
- **Production-Grade Quality**: Pass. Plan includes structured API contracts and tests.
- **Solo Developer Efficiency**: Pass. Reuses existing Admin PWA patterns and Recharts.
- **Data Security and Privacy**: Pass. Admin-only access, aggregated financial data.
- **Minimalist Development (YAGNI)**: Pass. Only specified visuals and controls included.

**Structure Decision**: Web application with FastAPI backend and Admin PWA frontend, matching existing monorepo layout.

## Phase 0: Research

Research focuses on confirming existing visualization and data-fetching patterns in the Admin PWA to minimize new dependencies. Decisions are documented in [research.md](research.md).

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

Data entities and API contracts are defined in [data-model.md](data-model.md) and [contracts/event-dashboard.yaml](contracts/event-dashboard.yaml). The quickstart workflow is documented in [quickstart.md](quickstart.md).

## Phase 2: Planning

Implementation tasks will be generated by `/speckit.tasks` after this plan is complete.

## Constitution Check (Post-Design)

Re-evaluate after Phase 1 artifacts are complete. No violations anticipated.

## Complexity Tracking

*No constitution violations requiring justification.*
