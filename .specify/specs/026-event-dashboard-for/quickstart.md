# Quickstart: Event Dashboard (Admin PWA)

## Admin Flow
1. Open the Admin PWA and select an event.
2. Navigate to the Event Dashboard.
3. Review total funds raised vs goal and the revenue source breakdown.
4. Adjust projection values by source or switch scenario (base/optimistic/conservative).
5. Review updated projected totals, pacing, and alert cards.
6. Use filters for date range and revenue source to refine the view.
7. Drill into tables, guests, registrants, or companies to review contribution rankings.
8. Use manual refresh or wait for the 60-second auto-refresh to update data.

## Notes
- Only Super Admin, NPO Admin, and NPO Staff roles can access the dashboard.
- Auto-refresh occurs every 60 seconds; manual refresh is always available.
- Auction-item analytics and donor-giving detail dashboards are out of scope for this feature.
